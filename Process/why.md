Assigned Theme: Clashing affect and clashing effect

##Jan. 31, 2025
Starting off this project, the most obvious motivation for why I'm doing this is, "because I had to for my degree," but think it is worth reflecting a bit up front on why I actually opted for a dark ride as opposed to any other form of theme park ride. Dark rides most obviously offer the strongest opportunities for theme and storytelling, but I think also have proliferated in recent years on the fundamental level of ride systemsâ€”dark rides aren't just small chain-driven carts anymore but are variously robotic arms, trackless cars, and interactive, providing new avenues not just for new themes but entirely new sensory or interactive experiences. I think something I want to make sure I tease out in whatever I end up designing is, beyond just another competent example of dark ride design, an illustration of these novel possibilities for what a dark ride is.
