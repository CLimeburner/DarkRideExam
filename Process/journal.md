Not a lot to write out for an initial design journal entry, however provided the assigned theme of, "clashing affect and clashing effect", I do want to record some thoughts. Regarding clashing affect, a lot of thrill rides are fundamentally grounded in a clash of affect between fear of something threatening and the triumph of facing and overcoming that fear. This might lead me to consider some of the scarier/intense dark rides on my mediography list like *Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man* (1999), *Revenge of the Mummy* (2004), or *Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey* (2010). I could also look to rides like *Haunted Mansion* (1969) that juxtapose something spooky with something silly or funny. On the side of clashing effects, I'm actually first reminded of a ride that's not in my mediography because it was a rollercoastâ€”*Dueling Dragons* (1999) at Universal's Islands of Adventure, which was two parallel coaster tracks themed around elemental dragons of fire and ice in an aerial dogfight. Considering some of the forceful special effects (fire, smoke, water, air) in dark rides, there might be an interest clashing, either between elements or otherwise between literal "effects".

Coming back to this a week later and not a lot of progress made. I've been reading, but also had some life stuff come up that ate up a lot of time. I think I'll likely move forward with the Quebecois folklore theme I'd initially identified, simply for the sake of staying on timeline.
