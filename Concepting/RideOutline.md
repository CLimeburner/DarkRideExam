#Ride Outline

**0 - Load**

Guests board their coaster train—shaped like a large canoe—along a gentle flume river surrounded by pine trees and snow.

**1 - Northern Forest**
Mood: Gentle, mysterious, unsettling
Intensity: Low
The train proceeds at a steady pace down the river, past a well-dressed gentleman with cat-like eyes and forked tail. This figure—the devil—briefly explains the deal: he will give their canoe the power of flight so the guests can fly home...

**2 - Waterfall**
Mood: Anxious, building tension
Intensity: Low/Medium
...but turning a corner, the guests find themselves staring down a waterfall ahead. The devil's face appears in a screen of mist warning them that if he or his minions catch the guests first, then their souls are his. The ride vehicle passes through the mist screen and initially drops, but then pulls out of the drop, soaring into the night sky.

**3 - Full Moon**
Mood: Relief, foreboding
Intensity: Medium
As the ride vehicle soars through the air, the full moon hangs low in the sky, silhouetting a wolfish figure on a distant crag as a baleful howl cuts through the night. The ride vehicle drops again, below the tree line where a snarling werewolf swipes at the canoe from amongst the trees.

**4 - Logging Camp**
Mood: Tense, scary, urgent
Intensity: High
As the canoe roars through a destroyed logging camp to escape the fearsome loup garou, the beast topples trees that appear to fall towards the ride vehicle as it swerves to avoid them.

**5 - Led Astray**
Mood: Gentle, inquisitive, suspenseful
Intensity: Low
Leaving the loup garou behind, the ride vehicle takes a gentler pace, winding between the trees towards feintly glowing lights in the distance. The devil's voice urges the guests to go toward the light, after all, what could do wrong following a will-o-wisp into the woods...

**6 - Great Balls of Fire**
Mood: Threatening, shocking
Intensity: Medium
...the canoe reaches the balls of light, suspended in the air, which suddenly flair into gouts of flame that blast heat at the guests before extinguishing suddenly in a spray of water as the fierce cry of the Corriveau splits the relative silence.

**7 - Clattering of the Cage**
Mood: Hasty, fearful
Intensity: High
The ride vehicle swerves through the night, pursued by the Corriveau who can be seen and heard briefly between the tree, clattering alongside the canoe in her gibbet cage. The voice of the devil refers to the woman executed and doomed forever to roam the woods—just like the guests are about to be...

**8 - Almost Dragged to Hell**
Mood: Tense, scary, threatening
Intensity: Low-to-Medium
The ride vehicle plunges into darkness. In a dim, red glow and oppressive heat, guests feel themselves pressed backward in their seats as demons swirl around them, dragging them backward toward hell as a light can be seen ahead, at the end of the tunnel. The devil initially laughs at his prize, but as the guests make progress, he cries out in disbelief as a screen of sulfurous smoke is suddenly blown away by cold, fresh air and the guests burst back into the night sky, soaring high above the trees.

**9 - Past the Steeple**
Mood: Relieved, triumphant, breathless
Intensity: Medium
Having just evaded the devil's damnation, the canoe takes a brief victory lap as it flies above a town, round the steeple of the church as the bell tolls out.

**10 - Splashdown**
Mood: Desperate, relived, braced
Intensity: High
The devil's voice calls out that although the guests may have escaped him, he won't make their landing any softer than it needs to be, and with that, the canoe plummets from the sky, splashing down into the river.

**11 - Unload**
Mood: Relief, safety, triumph
Intensity: Low
As the canoe floats into the unloading dock, a house alongside the river can be seen with silhouettes of people partying inside. The employees working the unload dock welcome the guests home.
