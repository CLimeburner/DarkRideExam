# High Concept

*As a bitter Winter storm settles over the frigid Canadian wilderness, you'll have to make a deal with the Devil to make it safely home—but be careful, the Devil hardly plays fair.*

You and your fellow riders find yourselves deep in the woods of the Canadian North, just as a dangerous blizzard sets in. All seems bleak, but a mysterious man with a forked tongue appears from the trees and offers to play a game—he'll give your canoe the power of flight, giving you a way home before you freeze, but if he or his friends can catch you before you make it home, he gets to keep your souls. With the bitter wind biting at your face and the sun setting, you have little choice but to accept this deal with the Devil.

Climb aboard your canoe and clutch tight to the gunwales—the night will be one to remember.
